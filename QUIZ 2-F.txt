PC PROBLEM/ERROR:
 PC won't boot to BIOS
Possible Cause of the Problem 
1.Misplaced front panel connectors-the first place to start is with the front panel
connectors.It seems silly that we still have to tumble around with a group of tiny wires while
referencing positive/negative schematics outlined in motherboard manual,but that's how it is.
2.Incorrectly seated RAM- make sure that you choose the right RAM and make sure that it is fully 
seated,as this is one of the common reasons why a PC fails to boot.
3.Missing power supply cables- be sure that you've plugged the appropriate PSU cables to the motherboards
4 pin or 8 pin CPU connector.
4.Overheating CPU-the first thing to look is the fan header.Make sure that you cooler's fan is plugged
into the CPU fan header on your motherboard.Remove and re-install the CPU cooler.Hopefully by reseating 
the cooler,it will make proper contact with the CPU, allowing your PC to boot
