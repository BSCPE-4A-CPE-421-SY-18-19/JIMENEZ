1.) How did the raspberry pi work?
 - The raspberry pi worked because the charger being used was compatible with the version 
which is the rasp pi B. At first testing, we used the charger of the rasp pi model B+ but it
didn't work. Then after which we try the charger with the same model of the rasp pi we're 
troubleshooting which is the rasp pi model B, it worked.
